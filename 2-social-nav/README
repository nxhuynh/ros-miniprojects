SOCIAL NAVIGATION

Description
-----------
This implementation simulates a robot following a subject (in this case another
turtle controlled from tutle_teleop_key). It also take into account the notion
of proxemics by keeping a predefined distance away from the subject. It also
simulate the mood of the follower over time. The follower would periodically
feel extroverted and wants to come closer to the subject to socialize, and
periodically have its introverted moments and want to move away from the
subject to be alone.


Implementation
--------------
* The following mechanism is implemented with tf broadcaster and listener
* To simulate the periodic mood, one of the transform coordinate is increase
  then decrease over time
* To keep a minimum distance from the subject, the varying transform 
  coordinate is checked against a minimum bound


Instruction
-----------
# to run:
	roslaunch social_nav start_demo.launch
